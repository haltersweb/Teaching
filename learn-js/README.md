## Basic JavaScript Tutorials
Each lesson is a fully formed web page.  See if you can re-create it
* retype each lesson's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file (DO NOT COPY AND PASTE)
* test and fix your version until it works like the version on the GitHub page.
* see if you can change something in your JavaScript to have your page do something slightly different.
